In this game, we need to use 
the arrow keys to move the circle.
to move the square, use W, A, S, and D. 
Every time the shapes collide, you get a point 
and the circle grows. 
When you are playing the game click the x in 
the corner and then click  'return to menu'.
You may check the scoreboard for your score 
after you have completed one round. 
The second game is Tic Tac Toe
Enjoy!
